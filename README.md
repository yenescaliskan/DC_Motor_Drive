Converters and rectifiers are crucial for the motor drive system in the power
electronics field. This project involves designing an AC/DC converter. The potential
topologies discussed in this report. The topology is chosen in consideration of the benefits
and drawbacks of the available options. It is explained why the preferred topology was
changed while preparing the simulation report before. The theory, computation and
simulations are provided for the chosen topology which is a Dimmer circuit with thyristor. The
necessary components are selected utilizing the findings of studies following simulation and
calculation analysis. Also, thermal analysis of the system is made. Then, the implementation
process carried out in line with the preferred components was also explained and the data of
the test results obtained were interpreted. Visuals and performance values of the final
product are also included in the report.
